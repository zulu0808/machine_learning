The project has raised a total of $ 480,000 from a prominent consortium comprising of crypto, fintech and DeFi investors based out of Singapore, India and the US.\r\nThe Router Protocol is in the process of creating a DeFi ecosystem that forms a bridge between layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain solutions. By doing so, it contributes towards scalability and encourages a greater penetration of DeFi solutions in a world that continues to be dominated by conventional financial infrastructure. Router achieves its mission by implementing a suite of cross-chain liquidity infra primitives.\r\nBy facilitating cross-chain interoperability, the Router Protocol connects blockchains to enable the free flow of information and value between them. In addition, it also empowers the connected networks with smart order-routing capabilities so that users can seamlessly swap assets between them in the most transparent manner.\r\nIn a recently published statement regarding the fundraising round, the Router Protocol team said," We believe that in the current DeFi environment and in the spirit of open-source building, there is no need for flashy VC names and glamorous NDAs. It's all about true value being added to the community, and real problems being solved as opposed to capturing the next wave of the perpetual crypto hype cycle..."\r\nWith the recently raised funds, the Router Protocol will be expanding the team as well as the number of supported blockchains and blockchain solutions. The Easy Access Program is another significant step in the development of Router Protocol as it will make the Router token readily available to the DeFi community much before it gets listed on centralized exchanges. The Easy Access Program for Router was oversubscribed within 19 minutes of listing.\r\nMeanwhile, the project will soon introduce cross-chain farming for providing liquidity on Ethereum and Matic, to be further expanded to other platforms in the near future. Liquidity providers on various exchanges like Uniswap, 1Inch, Sushiswap and Dfyn will be able to stake their LP tokens and earn Router's governance token - $ROUTE."},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"PRNewswire"},"author":null,"title":"Bitcoin System Review: Comprehensive Sign Up Guide For Bitcoin System Software","description":"NEW YORK, Jan. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Bitcoin System has emerged as one of the most trusted trading systems on the Internet because of its consistency in predicting the market's future positions.

It's an automated trading system that allows users to earn massive amounts of profits by executing potentially lucrative trade orders. The developers claim that the trading software has an astonishing success rate of 99.4% which means users will be able to win from every trade that gets executed. Now, it's necessary for users to know how the system works before they register on the platform. The software has a built-in algorithm that works on artificial intelligence (AI). \r\nREPORT IN THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://btc-system-pro.com/\r\nThe developers use various historical data figures of the Bitcoin market and other market parameters to speculate on the market. The developers ask the users to fix trading parameters according to their requirements and based on them, brings out the most profitable trading opportunities for them. And, the software also executes trade orders and books profits for users if they are trading in the auto-mode. The developers also claim that users may put their money in other cryptocurrencies as well. The software supports cryptos such as RippleCoin, LiteCoin, Ethereum, and others. MUST SEE: \"Shocking New Bitcoin System Report This May Change Your Mind\"\r\nEveryone must know that the technology used behind Bitcoin or any other digital currency is \"Blockchain technology\". So, the word, \"blockchain\", literally means \"a chain of blocks\". And, in each of these blocks, Bitcoin transactions are stored. Each block has a storage capacity of 1MB and once this capacity has been achieved, the Bitcoin protocol proceeds to store transactions in the succeeding block. And, the block which has exhausted its entire memory, is added to the chain of blocks. As Bitcoin developers might know, blockchain technology can be seen as a public distribution ledger that records transactions. Every block in one blockchain corresponds to a page in this ledger book. This ledger book is available in the public domain and anyone who wishes can look up any transaction. It makes the Bitcoin system transparent and decentralized, a network that cannot be regulated by any authority.\r\nThere are innumerable customer testimonials of the Bitcoin System trading platform across the Internet. Most people only have positive things to say about the platform. As the software boasts a success rate as astonishing as 99.4%, not many have anything negative to say of it. One customer, from California, says, \"I was laid off from my job last year once the coronavirus lockdowns were imposed by the governor. For a couple of months, I was struggling to provide for my family. Then, as I was searching for ways to earn income online, I came across the Bitcoin System trading platform. I read its reviews and registered on the software. I deposited funds in my trading account and since I knew nothing about trading, I switched on the auto-ode and let the platform do the work for me. By December, I was earning $200 in profits every day.\" There may be issues in the software but the developers keep updating it constantly and eliminate any bugs in it to make it more advantageous for its users.\r\nComing to signing up on the platform, it's free, and anyone can register on it. The only requirement is to be above 18 years old. They will have to provide their details on the homepage of the platform and fill the registration form given. After this, the next step is to deposit funds into their trading accounts. The start-up deposit is set at $250 by the developers. These funds are used by the software to execute lucrative trade orders for the users. Now, once the trading account is verified and activated by the software, users need to adjust their trading preferences, like the tokens they would like to invest in each trade and the time interval between trades. Finally, they can earn profits from the software. If they are using the auto-mode, the platform places trade orders for them, and in the manual mode, users have to execute orders on their own. \r\nThe withdrawal process of the platform is swift. Users need to fill in the required details and they will get the amount in their bank accounts within a day or two. It's a free trading platform and interested users can also try the platform's \"demo version\" before signing up on the software. It will give them a virtual feel of the software.\r\nOfficial Website: https://btc-system-pro.com/\r\nContact Details:Bitcoin System[email protected]TOLL FREE (888) 966-1522 \r\nSOURCE Bitcoin System\r\n Related Links\r\nhttps://btc-system-pro.com/"},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"PRNewswire"},"author":null,"title":"Bitcoin Evolution Review: Comprehensive Sign Up Guide For Bitcoin Evolution Trading App","description":"NEW YORK, Jan. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- When it comes to automated trading platforms, Bitcoin Evolution is already a proven software with thousands of users.

It helps users to earn huge amounts of profits by executing trade orders with the help of the trading signals provided by the Bitcoin Evolution platform. Its unmatched consistency and reliability make the trading software even more popular amongst users. The trading software not only supports trading of Bitcoin but also other altcoins like Ethereum, LiteCoin, RippleCoin, Bitcoin Cash to name a few.\r\nREPORT IN THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE: https://bitcoin-evolutionpro.com/\r\nThe software boasts a win rate of nearly 100% and a customer satisfaction rate of over 95%. Users find it easy to access and operate the features of the software. Now, coming to the working of the software, Bitcoin Evolution is in-built with a complex algorithm. This algorithm makes use of important market parameters and past data figures to analyze the Bitcoin market. It accurately predicts the future positions of the crypto market and provides trading signals to users. Then, the software also executes these trade orders for the traders. It makes the software even more handy as traders don't have to place trades on their own. They need to spend 20-30 minutes on the platform each day and collect their winnings. MUST SEE: \"Shocking New Bitcoin Evolution Report This May Change Your Mind\"\r\nBefore diving into other features of the trading platform, readers must understand the determinants of Bitcoin's price. It's a known fact that the progenitor of digital assets is a decentralized currency that cannot be monitored by any financial regulatory body. So, usual economic factors like inflation, tax raise, etc., which impact the stock market and the commodities market, don't affect the Bitcoin market. The rise and fall of the crypto market depend entirely on the basic laws of demand and supply. If the demand for Bitcoin rises, the value of the asset increases, and vice-versa. On the other hand, if the supply is limited, the price will rise, and it will fall if there's more supply.

As per the creators, the software satisfies around 95% of its customers. So, only 5% of them have any issues with it. There are hundreds of positive reviews of the software on the Internet. One of the users, from Pennsylvania, says, \"After my second child was born a few months back, the expenditure of our household increased by 4 times. I have a decent job that pays $40,000 annually but to fulfil the requirements of my family, I needed more. So, about two months back, in November, I decided to sign-up on the Bitcoin Evolution trading software. I was at first hesitant after I learned that the software places trades automatically, but I gave it a try. I deposited $300 as my first investment and by the end of the day when I opened it, my profits soared to $200! A huge thanks to the developers.\" There are similar reviews of the software. As the software boasts of a 99.4%-win rate, mathematically, there's negligible chance of suffering losses. \r\nTo register on the platform, users need to fill the sign-up form on the platform's landing page. They need to provide accurate details, such as their name, email ID, and mobile number. After this step comes the \"deposit\" step. $250 is the minimum deposit set by the platform. Now, the software encrypts the user's trading account and password protects it, thereby only giving users the access to their accounts. There are trading parameters to be set and once done, the software pulls out the most lucrative trading opportunities for the user. These trading opportunities are based on the trading preferences of the user. Now, if the user has switched on the auto-mode, the software places the trade on the behalf of the user. They can execute trades on their own if they are using the platform in the manual mode. According to the developer, users can win profits from every trade. \r\nIt's a free software and interested traders can sign up immediately to earn massive profits. There's only a small \"maintenance fee\" that needs to be paid by the user. The developer will deduct this amount from the profits earned by the user.\r\nOfficial Website: https://bitcoin-evolutionpro.com/\r\nContact Details:Bitcoin Evolution[email protected]TOLL FREE (888) 966-1522\r\nSOURCE Bitcoin Evolution\r\n Related Links\r\nhttps://bitcoin-evolutionpro.com/"},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Forbes"},"author":"Billy Bambrough, Contributor, \n Billy Bambrough, Contributor\n https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/","title":"As The Bitcoin Price Whipsaws, These Radical New Cryptocurrencies Are Still Soaring","description":"As investors weigh whether to add bitcoin to their portfolios, smaller new cryptocurrencies that power the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) market have soared-with some almost doubling over the last week...","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/01/16/as-the-bitcoin-price-whipsaws-these-radical-new-cryptocurrencies-are-still-soaring/","urlToImage":"https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F6002bc8142f0ed517c76527f%2F0x0.jpg","publishedAt":"2021-01-16T11:10:00Z","content":"Bitcoin has caught the eye of Wall Street and mainstream investors over the last month after the bitcoin price surged past its 2017 highs (and could now be poised to climb yet higher).\r\nThe bitcoin price has added a staggering 300% over the last year, touching $42,000 per bitcoin earlier this month before falling back slightly. \r\nAs investors weigh whether to add bitcoin to their portfolios, smaller new cryptocurrencies that power the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) market have soaredwith some almost doubling over the last week.\r\nMORE FROM FORBESBiden And The Fed Embark On Fresh Multi-Trillion Dollar Bitcoin 'Marketing Campaign'By Billy BambroughThe bitcoin price has lost around 6% over the last week as major DeFi tokens including polkadot, ...

Dezember 2017 für 19.497,40 Euro einen Bitcoin kaufte, verlor in einem Jahr 82 Prozent seines Einsatzes und saß am 16. März 2020 immer noch auf einem Verlust von 74 Prozent. Aber wer ihm weiterhin die Treue hielt, konnte seinen Einsatz bis Mitte Januar 2021 verdoppeln.\r\nBitcoin scheint das ultimative Medium für Zocker zu sein. Dennoch investieren Anleger wie die Stiftungen der Universitäten Harvard, Yale und Stanford sowie Hedgefonds-Legenden wie Paul Tudor Jones oder Stanley Druckenmiller in Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen. Was treibt sie an?\r\nMan könnte sagen, sie gehen einer neuen Spur nach. Bitcoin entstand auf dem Höhepunkt der Finanzkrise, als ein anonymer Informatiker, der sich Satoshi Nakamoto nannte, am 31. Oktober 2008 einen Vorschlag mit dem Titel Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System verschickte.\r\nDarin beschrieb er eine Software, mit der man ohne Banken oder andere Finanzfirmen, die gerade strauchelten, Geld elektronisch aufbewahren, verschicken und empfangen konnte. Zu diesem Zweck wurde das Bitcoin genannte elektronische Geld verschlüsselt und über ein Blockchain genanntes dezentrales Kontobuch übertragbar gemacht. Nakamotos Erfindung erwies sich als genial und wäre eines Nobelpreises mehr als würdig, wüsste man, wer hinter dem Pseudonym steckt.\r\nBitcoin entsteht als reine Zahlenkombination und ist durch keinen realen Wert wie eine Goldwährung oder eine, in der realen Welt entstandene Forderung wie unser bestehendes Kreditgeld gedeckt. Das hat die bis heute unbeantwortete Frage aufgeworfen, wie es denn zu bewerten sei.\r\nMatt Hougan und David Lawant schlagen in einem kürzlich erschienenen Bericht der CFA Institute Research Foundation vor, Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen wie Rohstoffe zu betrachten. Da es weder bei dem einen noch dem anderen Objekt laufende Erträge gibt, kann man sie nicht mit abgezinsten Zahlungsströmen bewerten. Man kann nur den Preis über die Betrachtung von Angebot und Nachfrage abschätzen.\r\nAn dieser Stelle finden Sie Inhalte von Drittanbietern \r\n Um mit Inhalten von Drittanbietern zu interagieren oder diese darzustellen, brauchen wir Ihre Zustimmung. \r\n Externe Inhalte aktivieren \r\nDa bei Bitcoin wie bei neun der Top-Ten-Kryptowährungen das Angebot limitiert ist, ergibt sich der Preis aus der Nachfrage. Diese entsteht durch das Zusammenwirken von geringen Transaktionskosten, eines großen Netzwerks und der Beschränkung des Angebots. Da in der Bitcoin-Blockchain nur circa sieben Transaktionen pro Sekunde verarbeitet werden können, eignet sie sich nicht für den Massenbetrieb.\r\nFür große Zahlungen hingegen ist die Währung attraktiv. Hougan und Lawan berichten von einer Überweisung von 161.500 Bitcoin im Wert von 1,1 Milliarden Dollar aus dem Jahr 2020. Sie erreichte ihren Empfänger sofort und kostete nur 0,68 Dollar. Eine übliche Banküberweisung ins Ausland hätte dagegen zwei Tage gedauert und mindestens zehn Millionen Dollar an Gebühren verschlungen.\r\nDa das Angebot von Bitcoin auf insgesamt 21 Millionen Stück begrenzt ist, wovon 18,6 Millionen schon emittiert sind, und auf die Haltung von Bitcoin weder Negativzinsen noch Bankgebühren anfallen, kann es prinzipiell zur Vorhaltung von Mitteln für größere Zahlungen dienen.\r\nEin weiterer Grund für die Nachfrage nach Kryptowährungen ist die Möglichkeit, Geldübertragungen an Bedingungen zu knüpfen. Da sich auf diese Weise Zahlungen an vertragliche Vereinbarungen koppeln lassen, spricht man von Smart Contracts und programmierbarem Geld.\r\nDafür wurde die Bitcoin-Blockchain bei Ethereum, der Kryptowährung mit der nach Bitcoin zweitgrößten Marktkapitalisierung, weiterentwickelt. Diese Technik ist vor allem für komplexere Finanztransaktionen interessant, so dass man von Decentralised Finance spricht.\r\nSchließlich gibt es auch Anwendungen, bei denen es auf hohe Transaktionsgeschwindigkeiten ankommt. Das gilt für Ripple, der nach Marktkapitalisierung viertgrößten Kryptowährung, die allerdings keine völlig, sondern eine kontrolliert dezentralisierte Blockchain nutzt.\r\nInsgesamt bieten die verschiedenen Blockchain-Techniken oder besser Distributed Ledger-Techniken jeweils spezifische Vorteile für bestimmte Anwendungen, so dass verschiedene Kryptowährungen durchaus nebeneinander existieren können. Dabei gilt erstens, dass die Technik auch vor Regierungen, die ihr Geldmonopol verteidigen wollen umso sicherer ist, je einfacher sie gestrickt ist. Und es gilt zweitens, dass die Währung umso attraktiver ist, je größer ihre Nutzergemeinde ist.\r\nFür Anleger können Kryptowährungen als Beimischung zu ihren Portfolios interessant sein. Zwar sind die Korrelationen des Preises von Bitcoin mit den Preisen von Aktien und Gold sehr instabil und im Verlauf des letzten Jahres gestiegen, was auf die ungezügelte Vermehrung des Kreditgelds durch die Zentralbanken zurückzuführen sein dürfte.\r\nDoch zeigen Berechnungen von Hougan und Lawant, dass die Beimischung von Bitcoin die Rendite eines Portfolios deutlich erhöhen kann, ohne die Schwankungen des Portfoliowerts in gleichem Maße zu vergrößern. Unterm Strich entsteht mit den Kryptowährungen eine neue Klasse von Vermögenswerten, die bei Anlegern zunehmend auf Interesse stößt. Doch ist sie wegen der großen Preisschwankungen nichts für Furchtsame.\r\nThomas Mayer ist Gründungsdirektor des Flossbach von Storch Research Institute und Professor an der Universität Witten/Herdecke"},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Elconfidencial.com"},"author":"Valor Añadido","title":"Segunda fiebre del Bitcoin: diferencias entre la burbuja de 2017 y este 'rally'","description":"Tras tocar máximos históricos en los 41.998 $, Bitcoin ha corregido con fuerza hasta la zona de los 30.000 $ desatando el debate entre los creyentes y los detractores de la criptodivisa","url":"https://www.elconfidencial.com/mercados/el-valor-anadido/2021-01-16/segunda-fiebre-del-bitcoin-diferencias-entre-la-burbuja-de-2017-y-este-rally_2907076/","urlToImage":"https://www.ecestaticos.com/imagestatic/clipping/985/d31/985d31e275a9932ca829e3ea7bf90982.jpg","publishedAt":"2021-01-16T04:00:00Z","content":"La pandemia mundial ha servido a los inversores para recordarles que existe un activo relativamente nuevo (10 años) que está tratando de hacerse un hueco en las carteras: las criptodivisas. La gran incertidumbre, el colapso de las economías, el hundimiento de los mercados financieros con hitos nunca vistos como el barril de petróleo en negativo y los tipos de interés en cero, si no en negativo, con unas inyecciones descomunales de capital por parte de los bancos entrales, empezaron a lanzar a muchos inversores, de nuevo, hacia las divisas digitales basadas en tecnología 'blockchain'.El 'rally' comenzó en el mes de marzo cuando la mayor parte de los países afectados por el coronavirus, los desarrollados y muchos emergentes, decidieron confinar a la población para frenar los contagios del covid-19. Desde entonces, las criptodivisas no han parado de crecer y las correcciones que han experimentado en estos meses no han sido más que un paso atrás para coger impulso.Tanto es así que desde el 16 de marzo, cuando tocó por última vez los 5.000 dólares por token hasta los 38.000 dólares en los que cerró este jueves Bitcoin -que es la cripto por excelencia-, se ha disparado un 660%. Y llegó a marcar un nuevo máximo histórico en los 41.998 dólares por token hace una semana para después desplomarse un 20% justo en la siguiente sesión.La última corrección ha puesto al mercado en guardia y teme estar viviendo un 'déjà vu' de 2017De hecho, ha sido esta fuerte corrección la que esta semana ha puesto en guardia al mercado, que teme estar viviendo un 'déjà vu' de 2017 cuando, entre mediados de marzo y diciembre, Bitcoin se disparó un 1.900% hasta los 19.345 dólares por token -que tocó tras empezar a cotizar en el mercado de futuros de Chicago- para desplomarse inmediatamente después hasta los 12.500 dólares y de ahí en caída libre hasta los 3.228 en 2019.Los expertos están polarizadosPero entre 2017 y 2020 hay una serie de diferencias que hacen que en esta ocasión no exista consenso en el mercado -hace cuatro años coincidían en el pinchazo inminente de la burbuja- y los expertos se encuentren polarizados entre los creyentes y los desconfiados. No en vano, si hay una característica que viene acompañando a las criptodivisas desde su creación es su elevada volatilidad que ha llevado en varias ocasiones a muchos inversores a perderlo prácticamente todo.Por lo pronto, no es que entre el hito del viernes y el lunes, cuando cayó hasta los 30.000 dólares, haya desaparecido la fiebre del Bitcoin. Al contrario, hubo quien aprovechó la corrección para unirse a la fiesta y desde esos niveles ha vuelto a rebotar hasta el entorno de los 39.000 dólares. Un gráfico que ha dado argumentos a varios analistas a establecer en la banda de los 30.000 dólares y los 32.000 dólares un soporte difícil de romper. Es el caso del CEO de la plataforma CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, que explica que en tanto que este es el precio en el que han comprado muchos institucionales y grandes firmas, se habría reforzado el 'rally' de las últimas semanas aumentando las posibilidades, además, de que finalmente el mercado pueda contar con un ETF (fondo cotizado) de Bitcoin que permita la entrada de otros institucionales que hasta ahora no han podido por sus limitaciones de inversión.Bitcoin multiplicará su precio 10 veces más que el valor del oroFirmas como JP Morgan han pasado de afirmar que \"Bitcoin es un fraude peor que la burbuja de los Tulipanes\" (Jamie Dimon, septiembre 2017), a asegurar en su 'Flows & Liquity' que \"Bitcoin multiplicará su precio 10 veces más que el valor del oro\". De hecho, en su publicación insignia el banco hablaba de su atractivo por \"un potencial alcista como ningún otro activo\" y asegura que podría subir hasta los 146.000 dólares para llegar a competir con el oro como \"moneda alternativa\".Así, en esta ocasión se puede decir que el mercado de las criptodivisas se encuentra en un mayor punto de maduración, con la entrada no solo de inversores institucionales, sino desde finales de diciembre también de inversores 'retail' y con avances hacia una mayor regulación. De hecho, el propio Banco Central Europeo (BCE) se ha remangado y apuesta por una regulación global para Bitcoin y por una acción coordinada para que se quite el estigma de dar cobijo a \"actividades reprobables\" como el blanqueo de capitales, según ha declarado esta semana su presidenta, Christine Lagarde.\r\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}(); Por otro lado, a diferencia del mercado que había hace un lustro, en esta ocasión el 'rally' no es generalizado sino que se ha concentrado principalmente en Bitcoin y en Ethereum. Además, mientras que en 2017 apenas había 'stablecoins', esto es, otro tipo de criptodivisas con tokens asociados al valor de una moneda fíat o a bienes materiales como el oro, inmuebles o a otras criptodivisas para reducir la volatilidad.\r\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}(); \r\nOtro de los aspectos que empiezan a darle más músculo a las criptodivisas como activo válido es su adopción por las empresas. Las divisas digitales empiezan a aparecer desde en balances de empresas cotizadas como MassMutual, que ha invertido 100 millones de dólares en Bitcoin, hasta en PayPal.\r\nY finalmente, cada vez hay más escasez. No en vano, el minado de Bitcoin es finito o, lo que es lo mismo, su emisión está limitada a 21 millones de Bitcoin; y teniendo un modelo de incentivos establecido para garantizar la seguridad de la red (es lo que hacen en los mineros), el impacto que el próximo 'halving' o reducción de aquellas recompensas tendrá en los precios puede ser clave para su consolidación definitiva como activo refugio."},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Yahoo Entertainment"},"author":"Bob Mason","title":"The Crypto Daily - Movers and Shakers - January 16th, 2021","description":"It's a bullish start to the day for the majors.

Life-changing wealth was generated, then lost as quickly as it arrived.\r\nThe spark to kick this off was supposed to be Bitcoin passing $20,000 but that feat came and went, and only now are altcoins popping off while Bitcoin has begun to downtrend. It has a top crypto trader "cautious" about a potential "blow-off top" in altcoins. And here's why.\r\nChainlink and Polkadot are beginning to eclipse Bitcoin | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\r\nAltcoin Season While BTC Drops Has Marked Past Crypto Market Tops\r\nCrypto trader Johnny Moe is approaching the current price action across crypto, and for good reason. Bitcoin is downtrending, all while altcoins are soaring. Polkadot gained 75% in two days, and Chainlink just set a new all-time high.\r\nBitcoin and altcoins tend to uptrend together, the handful of times when the two asset types diverged, it has signaled a top was in. Altcoins were recently surging alongside Bitcoin as it pushed above $40,000 and setting new all-time highs, but the latest rally in altcoins is taking place while the leading cryptocurrency by market cap is turning down.\r\nBitcoin's rejection at $40,000 recently is the first higher low on daily timeframes in months, and if a lower low is put in, the cryptocurrency will have by definition fallen into a downtrend. Altcoin price action continuing to fly while Bitcoin dives, could be a repeat of the conditions that caused the 2017 peak.\r\nRelated Reading | Capital Manager: Ethereum Will Double In Two Weeks Once ATH Is Broken\r\nIf this is indeed the top, it might be bad for Bitcoin, but altcoins could have another two more weeks left of momentum and gains before the blow-off top is complete and the rest of the crypto market turns around.\r\nIs this trader right to be cautious? Or is bear market PTSD getting the best of them, and this latest "downtrend" is just another opportunity to buy the dip?\r\nFeatured image from Pixabay, Charts from TradingView.com"},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Yahoo Entertainment"},"author":"Bob Mason","title":"Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple's XRP - Daily Tech Analysis - January 16th, 2021","description":"It's a bullish start to the day for the majors.

The tokens give K-Pop fans and other investors a claim of real ownership in digital products related to RBW entertainers. \r\nRead more: NFT Art Sales Reached All-Time High of $8.2M in December\r\nIn an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the Xeno team announced that RBW has given the NFT exchange exclusive rights to mint and list their NFT-based digital products.\r\nFanbases get digital goods for their favorite artists that they can truly own, and artists and content creators get new and exciting products to offer their fans, Jae-Woong Wang, CEO of RBW Japan, told CoinDesk in a statement. Digital event tickets, membership tokens, even digital content rights can all be captured and housed within NFTs. The trend of digital commerce is growing and RBW wants to stay on top of these trends while at the same time open new markets when possible.\r\nThe exact time of when the NFTs will be launched has yet to be announced. Xeno told CoinDesk that the underlying digital products will include "3D model renderings" of fans' favorite K-Pop idols, event tickets for virtual concerts and membership tokens that "allow artists to engage their fanbases".\r\nRBWs move comes at a time of explosive growth in trading volumes for NFTs, which tripled in 2020 compared to 2019, according to data from Dune Analytics. The increased interest in NFTs is partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced most cancellation of in-person events.\r\nUnlike fungible cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, NFTs are unique tokens that cannot be exchanged one to one. For fans of Mamamoo, that translates into ownership of a unique digital product developed around the singers.\r\nXenos NFT marketplace launched last month after the company saw a potentially huge market for NFTs in East Asia, Xeno's president, Anthony Di Franco, told CoinDesk. The company currently operates primarily in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.\r\nRead more: The Blockchain NFT Wars Are Here\r\nSouth Korea alone has the fourth-largest gaming market in the world, with well-established digital goods marketplaces, Di Franco said. The East Asian country also has very high engagement with all forms of entertainment including the K-Pop industry. The Gaon Digital Chart, South Korea's music industry standard ranking recorded singles, shows nearly 21 million weekly plays for this week's No. 1 song alone.\r\nRBWs news could lead more prominent entertainment companies in East Asia to follow the NFT trend, as most live events around the world are still on pause due to the pandemic, according to the executives at Xeno. Besides those in K-Pop, several partnerships with well-established names in high fashion and the online gaming industries are already in the pipeline," the exchange said. \r\nRBW is a fairly moderately impactful company, with popular girl group Mamamoo along with several boy bands and a new girl group, Purple Kiss, under its management, Tamar Herman, K-Pop journalist at Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, told CoinDesk in an email. The company has a reputation for high-value performances and artistry.\r\nWhile most NFT exchanges are based on the Ethereum blockchain, Xeno is built on the Polkadot network because of its better scalability, full cross-chain interoperation and integration, and Polkadots unique parachain feature that gives the team full control of the protocol layer of the system, Di Franco told CoinDesk.\r\nRead more: Some Asian Traders Are Using Polkadot to Predict Bitcoins Future\r\nNFTs are the perfect medium for these habits to grow and evolve in, Di Franco said. NFTs take ownership of digital goods out of their silos, turning a collection of mutually exclusive walled gardens into a true marketplace, and exponentially increasing the possibilities for creative entrepreneurship for digital artists and the business opportunities for the platforms they work on."},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Mercola.com"},"author":"communities@mercola.com (Dr. Joseph Mercola)","title":"The Plan for a Global System of Slavery","description":"How do you market and implement a financial system that nobody would want if they understood its full ramifications - a change so huge that it not only would mean the end of currency as we know it, but a total revision of sovereignty and individual rights?\n\nI...","url":"https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/01/16/slavery-system.aspx","urlToImage":"https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/Public/2021/January/FB/transhumanism-fb.jpg","publishedAt":"2021-01-16T00:00:00Z","content":"Disclaimer: The entire contents of this website are based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola, unless otherwise noted.

Inflation means that prices for things are rising, and so the same amount of money buys less. So, over time, inflation eats away at the value or worth of your money.\r\nThat's especially bad for people holding cash - or funds in checking or savings accounts, which usually don't offer much of a return. \r\nThe solution is investing for inflation - choosing investments that will give you a return greater than the current rate of inflation - or that at least, that keeps up with it. \r\n Here's everything you need to know about investing to beat inflation, and which investments make the best inflation hedge. \r\nWhat is inflation?\r\nInflation refers to rising prices on goods and services across an economy over a period of time.\r\nWe measure inflation with the \"inflation rate,\" calculated as a percentage of change of a price index (a representative sampling of goods and services) from one year to the next. In the US, the most commonly used price index is the consumer price index (CPI), but sometimes economists will also use the producers price index (PPI).\r\nInflation below 2.3% is considered low. It's considered mild between 2.3% and 3.3% and high between 3.3% and 4.9%. Inflation above 4.9% is considered to be very high. \r\nInflation isn't all bad. Economists like to see a low, steady rise in prices, because it means a healthy economy: Companies are producing, consumers are buying, business and employment and wages are all up. Currently, the US Federal Reserve targets an average annual inflation rate of 2%. \r\nHow inflation reduces the buying power of your money \r\nLow inflation may be good for the economy, but it's bad for your wallet. \"If annual inflation rates hit 5%, a dollar will only be worth $0.95 cents the following year,\" says Mark Williams, master lecturer in finance at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. \r\nAnd it's not just cash that loses value. \r\nWilliams notes that those with low-interest bank accounts effectively lose money during periods of inflation because the interest they pay is eaten up by the decline in value. Indeed, any investment that pays a fixed rate of return or interest will see diminished returns in real dollars during inflation.\r\nSo while inflation impacts all investors, it's especially tough on income-oriented investors. \r\nWhat types of assets are good for beating inflation?\r\nSeveral asset classes in particular lend themselves to inflation-oriented investing. \r\n<ul><li>Appreciation-oriented assets. Go for investments that offer growth, or appreciation - not simply income. Company stock is a prime example. </li><li>Real assets. Inflation devalues nominal assets, like CDs and traditional bonds, because they're priced based on the fixed interest they pay, which will lose value when inflation is increasing. In contrast, real assets are tangible things with fundamental value. So their worth floats up together with inflation.</li><li>Variable interest-rate assets. If something pays a fixed rate, you'll lose money in an inflationary environment. Assets with fluctuating interest rates give your money more of a fighting chance, as they'll also rise with inflation.</li></ul>Which particular investments make good inflation hedges?  \r\nCertain specific investments do well when inflation is climbing. Choosing among these assets should reflect your own goals, and also how severe the inflationary climate is.  \r\nStocks\r\nRising prices can mean more profit for companies, which in turn boosts share prices. No guarantees, of course, but over the long term, the stock market has historically provided returns that beat inflation. Technology and other growth stocks, which outperform the overall market, make the most solid hedges against inflation. Consumer goods companies and others in the defensive sector, which produce basics people need, also do well. \r\nCommodities\r\n\"Commodities tend to have outsized returns during times of high inflation,\" says Adem Selita, CEO of the Debt Relief Company. Commodities are a type of real asset, commodities are things like crops, raw materials, or natural resources. Their prices go up those of other goods or services that use those goods.  \r\nGold in particular has long been considered an inflation hedge. So are energy commodities, like oil and gas.\r\nReal estate\r\nReal estate is both a real asset and an appreciation-oriented one. Like commodities, land and property values tend to rise alongside inflation. If you're not ready to buy actual property, you can still invest in real estate through a real estate investment trust (REIT). These are publicly traded portfolios of properties; although technically securities, they are influenced by real estate trends.\r\nAlternative investments/tangible assets\r\nWilliams notes that some other tangible assets, such as fine art, vintage cars, and other collectibles, also tend to work well as a hedge against inflation. Again, these are real assets that have intrinsic value to collectors. Although their prices can be hard to predict, the value of these items is expected to appreciate over time, providing returns greater than the inflation rate. \r\nQuick Tip: Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and Ethereum, may also protect against inflation because there is a cap on their supply. But since cryptocurrencies are so new, dating back to 2010, it's not clear how they'll perform during times of high inflation - they haven't been around in that sort of environment.\r\nTIPS \r\nMost bonds are not good choices to hedge against inflation. The reason is that these investments pay a fixed rate of interest throughout their years- or decades-long lifespans. Their prices on the secondary market might change, but the interest rate they pay is typically not adjusted. \r\nBut some bonds, like US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), have interest rates that are indexed to inflation. That means that their interest payments go up with the inflation rate - and down with deflation - ensuring the payments' worth isn't too badly eroded. \r\nBecause they're backed by the US government, TIPs are highly safe, and a good choice for conservative investors.\r\nYou can use debt to deal with inflation too \r\nDebt may seem like the opposite of an investment. But incurring it can also be a good financial move when inflation is rampant. \r\nSelita notes that inflation makes it cheaper to service - that is, pay - some types of debt, as long as it has a fixed interest rate. In the same way that inflation eats away at the value of your cash, it also eats away at the value of your loan. This benefits individuals that have acquired loans or mortgages in the past, before the period of inflation set in.\r\nFor example, $1 in 1990 is equivalent to about $2 today, so a $1,000 mortgage payment 30 years ago would be worth about $2,000 now. But after all that time, you'd still be paying $1,000 per month. So the value of what you need to pay is reduced by about half. Effectively, you're paying half as much each month to service the debt.\r\nIf you can refinance, try changing your loan or mortgage to a fixed rate rather than a variable rate. That will leverage inflation to your advantage.\r\nThe financial takeaway\r\nInvesting for inflation is essential for protecting your wealth.\r\nInflation can erode your savings. So, while keeping some cash handy is great for financial security, it's best not to keep too much. If you do, you may find that it just doesn't buy as much as it used to.\r\nInstead, plan for inflation by making your money earn. Choose an investment strategy that's likely to give you a return that at least keeps up with the inflation rate. Look for assets that appreciate, that have a fundamental value of their own, or that pay interest at a fluctuating rate. \r\nBy keeping up with inflation, you can maintain the value of your money. And maybe even grow it. \r\nRelated Coverage in Investing:"},{"source":{"id":null,"name":"Bitcoin Magazine"},"author":"Edan Yago","title":"The Sudden, Unexpected End of Crypto Tribalism","description":"The last decade has been good to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Despite the fact that Bitcoin is perhaps the most disruptive technology to the status quo since the printing press, the powers-that-be have mostly left us alone. Sure, exchanges have been obliged to perform KYC measures, there've been a few darkmarket arrests, China banned Bitcoin a few times and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission went after some ICOs. But these regulatory responses are the bare minimum, the same regulations are applied to the very scary antiques market. \r\nFor a decade, we have been left largely to our own devices while enjoying the unprecedented luxury of a growth rate that has averaged thousands percent. To be extremely successful, all you had to do was buy some bitcoin and then do nothing. In fact, you didn't even need to do that, you could have chosen the cryptocurrency you were going to buy by throwing darts while drunk and blindfolded and you still would have seemed like a genius for buying XRP. \r\nSo, we did what people always do when they are free from any real troubles we turned on each other. Bitcoin hated Ethereum. BCH hated Bitcoin. Monero hated Zcash. And everyone hated Ripple. We whiled away the hours of our idyllic age of innocence, by going to Twitter and telling people to "have fun staying poor idiot." It felt important. \r\nUndoubtedly there are important differences between Bitcoin and, say, Ethereum. There might also be a very real sense in which they are competing with each other. While we had no problems more important to attend to, the rivalry, and its intensity, perhaps made sense. \r\nEnd Of Innocence\r\nThis tribalism is soon going to come to a very sudden end. Bitcoin and crypto have become too big to ignore. Leviathan is stirring. Even in the minds of the most unimaginative of bureaucrats, the realization is starting to dawn: "This is not a toy, this is not some millennial fad. This is our control over the monetary and financial system that these kids are coming after..."\r\nMonero is being delisted from exchanges. An Ethereum Core dev and the BitMEX CTO have been arrested. The Travel Rule is being adjusted special, just for us. In the U.S., in Europe, in Israel and soon everywhere, you must disclose your crypto holdings, not just when you sell but always. \r\n"First they laugh at you, then they ignore you, then they fight you..." \r\nCongratulations everyone, they are getting ready to fight us. No pretendsies anymore. This fight will be for keeps. Are you ready? They say you can't fight City Hall. Well, how about fighting a global coalition of nations with nuclear weapons and interpol at its disposal that can make the financial rules up as they go along? \r\nWe are going to need every ally we can get, even if they are an imperfect shitcoiner. \r\nNew Battle Lines\r\nIt's actually even worse than that. Those closest to us are going to be the ones to turn the knife. For a decade, we have been entrusting our funds to exchanges and relying on them as our on- and offramps. We have also been praying that this would be the "year the institutions come." Well, the exchanges have built huge businesses that they now need to protect. They have shareholders to whom they must answer. They have precious regulatory licences that were expensive to acquire and are easy to lose. \r\nCoinbase is going to conduct an IPO. Kraken has become a bank. Banks were an invention of the free market. They have been co-opted into a quasi-arm of the government and have become the primary enforcers of the financial surveillance state. How long before Kraken has its tentacles in your finances, operating under instructions from the regulator? How long before we  begin to see all those institutions we summoned digest crypto companies in an orgy of M&amp;A?\r\nIf you imagined that institutions getting interested in Bitcoin meant that they would begin to lobby on our behalf, you were mistaken. They will lobby on behalf of their own interests: to be mandatory middlemen, who must approve your every transaction and who take a cut for the trouble. The exchanges that served us so well over all of these years, who offered us great convenience in exchange for the mere trifle of controlling our keys these exchanges run by Bitcoin OGs they are no longer our friends. The age of innocence is over. \r\nTogether, We Shall Overcome\r\nNothing unites a community like a common foe. As large as the perceived differences between the different crypto tribes might be, they pale in comparison to the gulf between us and the nocoiners. Right now, we live in a nocoiner world. A fiat world of central authorities, financial surveillance and crony capitalism. The nocoiners have the power by default. We must choose to either unite, or allow them to succeed through a strategy of divide and conquer. \r\nThe great underdog success stories have always required the revolutionaries to put aside their differences and unite. The squabbling Greeks came together to defeat the Persians and defend their democracy. The competing houses of England paused their fighting and forced King John to sign the Magna Carta. The States of America forgot their ideological and religious differences, defeated the Red Coats and won their independence.\r\nThis hour calls for us to unite. While I am sure we will struggle to do so, I am confident that as the battle lines become clear, we will rise to the occasion and focus on the mission we have in common. This is why I am excited to see projects like Sovryn and TBTC; mission-driven projects, true to our trustless values, bringing together the worlds of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\r\nThe higher stakes, the more intense the need for unity. \r\nAt the Hot Gates, the Spartans were outflanked and massacred. At Marathon, however, they stood shoulder to shoulder with their arch-enemy, the Athenians. That day, free men won a victory for liberty that we benefit from to this day. Even the Spartans couldn't HODL alone.\r\nThis is a guest post by Edan Yago.
